    <h2>Examples of Generative AI</h2>

    <ul class="tech-list">
      <!-- AI chatbots Example -->
      <li>
        <strong>1. Chatbots</strong>
        <details>
          <summary>See Impact</summary>
          <p>
            Chatbots such as <strong>ChatGPT and GoogleBard</strong> have significantly improved customer support across all different queries and topics. Their ability to create <strong>extensive responses</strong> while providing support
            at anytime of the day gets rid of the need for human availability 24/7. However, there are some concerns when it comes to generative chatbots. The world's dependance on these chatbots can lead to reduced human interaction and social skills, which makes for  a less personal customer experience.

        <strong>2. Image Generation</strong>
        <details>
          <summary>See Impact</summary>
          <p>
            AI image generators such as <strong>DALL-E and Midjourney</strong> have allowed users to create content beyond their wildest imagination and to suit any of their needs.
            Similarly to chatbots, AI image generation can give you what you are requesting almost instantly allowing the user to have full access to whatever images they would like. 
            However, with the easy use of AI image generation, there are some ethical concerns to be had. Issues about intellectual property rights, authenticity, and licensing are just a few worries people have.
            A large example of this comes in the form of fake news/propoganda. People are able to create images allowing them to publish articles about events that never even happened.

        <strong>3. Music Generators</strong>
        <details>
          <summary>See Impact</summary>
          <p>
          AI music generation is a new concept that is currently changing the music industry. Generators are able to use machine learning algorithims to analyze existing songs
          to create new music. This allows artists to create tracks made entirely with AI. Generators in music are also able to help artists when it comes to production. They are able to 
          analyze tracks and make decisions about what elements need to get adjusted. As AI continues to develop there are more concerns growing for it's impact on the music industry.
          Many people argue that AI music takes all the authenticity from human made content because it is all just generated automatically.

    <h2>Ethical Concerns & Risks of AI</h2>
    <p>
      While AI brings many advantages, it also comes with significant ethical concerns.  
      Misuse of AI and inherent biases in machine learning models pose risks that must be addressed.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary>Key Ethical Concerns</summary>
      <ul class="ai-risks-list">
        <li>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>AI Misuse:</strong>  
          AI has the potential to be used for misinformation, deepfakes, and fraud, creating risks for individuals and organizations.  
          For example, deepfake videos can manipulate reality, leading to political misinformation or impersonation fraud.  
          Additionally, AI-generated phishing scams and fake content can deceive users, causing financial and reputational damage.
        </li>
    
        <li>ü§ñ <strong>Bias in AI:</strong>  
          Many AI models inherit biases from the data they are trained on, leading to unfair, discriminatory, or unethical outcomes.  
          Examples include AI-powered hiring tools that favor certain demographics.
          If not carefully managed, these biases can reinforce existing inequalities and cause significant societal harm.
