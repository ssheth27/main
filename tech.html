    <h2>Examples of Generative AI</h2>

    <ul class="tech-list">
      <!-- AI chatbots Example -->
      <li>
        <strong>1. Chatbots</strong>
        <details>
          <summary>See Impact</summary>
          <p>
            Chatbots such as <strong>ChatGPT and Google Gemini</strong> have significantly improved customer support across all different queries and topics. Their ability to create extensive responses instantaneously voids the need for human availability 24/7. However, there are some concerns when it comes to generative chatbots. 
            The world's dependance on these can lead to reduced human interaction and social skills, which makes for a less personal customer experience.

        <strong>2. Image Generation</strong>
        <details>
          <summary>See Impact</summary>
          <p>
            AI image generators such as <strong>DALL-E and Midjourney</strong> have allowed users to create content beyond their wildest imagination and to suit any of their needs.
            Similarly to chatbots, AI image generation can give you what you are requesting almost instantly allowing the user to have full access to whatever images they would like. 
            However, with the easy use of AI image generation, there are some ethical concerns to be had. Issues about intellectual property rights, authenticity, and licensing are just a few major concerns.
            A large example of this comes in the form of fake news or propaganda. People are able to create images allowing them to publish articles about events that never even happened.

        <strong>3. Music Generators</strong>
        <details>
          <summary>See Impact</summary>
          <p>
          <strong> AI music generation</strong> is a new concept that is currently changing the music industry. Generators are able to use machine learning algorithims to analyze existing songs
          to create new music. This allows artists to create tracks made entirely with AI. Generators in music are also able to help artists when it comes to production. They are able to 
          analyze tracks and make decisions about effects need to be adjusted. As AI continues to develop there are more concerns growing for it's impact on the music industry.
          Many people argue that these generators take all the authenticity from human made content.
